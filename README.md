# NodeWirelessClock

This arduino program uses a NodeMCU v3 hardware with an OLED 0.96'' 128x64 I2C. You need to have a Wundergraound free account to retrive your API key and insert it in the NodeTime.ino file. You need also a youtube account to retrieve Youtube abalytics and you need to configure your wireless network to connect it to internet.

For any other info feel free to contact me. If you have any suggestion for development feel free to advise... any comment is more than wellcome!!!!
